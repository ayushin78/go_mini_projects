# Exercise 3 - Choose Your Own Adventure

Choose Your Own Adventure is (was?) a series of books intended for children where as you read you would occasionally be given options about how you want to proceed. For instance, you might read about a boy walking in a cave when he stumbles across a dark passage or a ladder leading to an upper level and the reader will be presented with two options like:

Turn to page 44 to go up the ladder.
Turn to page 87 to venture down the dark passage.

The goal of this exercise is to recreate this experience via a web application where each page will be a portion of the story, and at the end of every page the user will be given a series of options to choose from (or be told that they have reached the end of that particular story arc).

Stories will be provided via a JSON file.
